*Data for the Jesuit Catalogs, a Project by the Institute for Advanced Jesuit Studies, Boston College*

## About

Jesuit Catalogs Database is the new digital research tool being developed by the Institute for Advanced Jesuit Studies in collaboration with the Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu and Boston College Libraries to facilitate research not only on the Society of Jesus, but also on modern age history. By indexing all the information from the Triennales catalogs, the platform will provide long-term historical qualitative and quantitative data on the Society of Jesus and its social history.

This is a full stack app (MySQL ExpressJS Angular NodeJS), and **this repository contains only the seeder data**.

For the API, see [this repository](https://github.com/BCDigSchol/jesuit-catalogs-server). For the front-end interface, see [this repository](https://github.com/BCDigSchol/jesuit-catalogs-client).
